# Targeter Game Controller

The Targeter Game Controller is a project implemented on the ATMega328P microcontroller, which communicates with a game using UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter). The controller is equipped with an HW-504 joystick to provide input to the game, allowing players to navigate and interact within the gaming environment.

## Features

- Utilizes the ATMega328P microcontroller for handling game controls.
- Communicates with the game using UART for real-time interaction.
- Incorporates an HW-504 joystick for precise and dynamic control.
- Displays essential game information on an attached LCD screen.
- Supports features such as button status, joystick position, ammunition count, and player score.

## Hardware Requirements

- ATMega328P Microcontroller
- HW-504 Joystick
- UART Communication
- LCD Display

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the ATMega328P microcontroller and connect the HW-504 joystick, UART communication, and LCD display as per the provided circuit.
3. Compile and upload the code to the ATMega328P microcontroller.
4. Run the system and observe real-time communication and control with the connected game.

## Usage

- Navigate the game environment using the HW-504 joystick.
- Monitor ammunition count, player score, and other game information on the attached LCD screen.
- Experience responsive and accurate control through UART communication.
